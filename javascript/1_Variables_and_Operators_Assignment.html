<h1>Try the following exercises by adding code to a script tag in your HTML file:</h1>

    Add 2 numbers together! In your script, type in console.log(23 + 97). Running this should log 120.
    <script>console.log(23 + 97) //120</script>
    Do the same thing but add 6 different numbers together.
    <script> console.log(10+22+93+44+51+26) //246 </script>
    Now log the value of the following expression: (4 + 6 + 9) / 77. The console should log approximately 0.24675.
    <script>console.log((4 + 6 + 9) / 77)  //0.24675324675324675 </script>
    Let’s use some variables!
        Add this statement to the script tag: let a = 10.
        Below it, add console.log(a). When you run this, the browser console should log 10.
        Afterwards, re-assign a with a different number value. Log a again afterwards and it should show the updated value (the previous log should still show the old value of 10 since that was before a was re-assigned).
        Now add to the bottom of the script let b = 7 * a.
        Log what b is. It should log the result of 7 multiplied by whatever you re-assigned a with.
        <script>
            let a = 10
            console.log(a)//10
            a = 100
            console.log(a)//100
            let b = 7 * a
            console.log(b) //700
        </script>
    Try this sequence:
        Declare a const variable max with the value 57.
        Declare another const variable actual and assign it max - 13.
        Declare another const variable percentage and assign it actual / max.
        Now if you log percentage, you should see a value in the console like 0.7719.
        <script>
            const max = 57
            const actual = max - 13
            const percentage = actual/max
            console.log(percentage) //0.7719298245614035
        </script>
    Take a few minutes to keep playing around with various things in your script tag. Eventually, we will learn how to actually make these things show up on the webpage, but all of this logic will remain the same. Make sure you’re comfortable with it before moving on.

Go through the following articles to deepen your knowledge.

    Read up on variables in JavaScript from JavaScript.info.
    This W3Schools lesson on JavaScript arithmetic followed by this on JavaScript numbers, are good introductions to what you can accomplish with numbers in JavaScript.
    This MDN article on JavaScript math covers the same info from a slightly different point of view, while also teaching you how to apply some basic math in JavaScript. There’s much more that you can do with numbers, but this is all you need at the moment.
    Read through (and code along with!) this article on JavaScript operators. Don’t forget to do the “Tasks” at the bottom of the page! It will give you a pretty good idea of what you can accomplish with numbers (among other things!) in JavaScript.
        <script>

            let x = 5
            let y = 5.00
            console.log(x==y) // true, same values
            
            console.log(x===y) //true, same values and same type "Number", while checking type JavaScript wont see if its float or int but a 'Number'
            //but
            let z = "5"
            console.log(x===z)//this should give false, it does
            //NaN means Not a Number which means trying to perform operations with string not containing numbers will give this error
            console.log(10/"Hello") //output: NaN
            //trying to decrement and increment numbers
             //x++ //adds 1
             //y-- //subtracts 1
            
             
            console.log(x++); // postincrement means print first and then increment
            console.log(++y); //preincrement means increment first and then print
            
            //operator precedence is the prioritization of operators in order to know their sequence of execution in an expression
            // if the precedence is same,itll execute left to right first

            //unary adds the string representations of integers, but if unary is alone with the string like the given example, nothing happens
            console.log(+"10") //nothing happens because its unary in nature
            console.log(+"10"+"20") //output becomes 1020 because its technically "10"+"20" which is binary in nature
            
            
        </script>
